This is my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut. Surely, this person has seen more in his lifetime than most of us can or even want to.

The book is based off his experiences in World War II. It also comments upon society’s harmless and indulging relationships that come with preset notions and a set of rules about the roles we take. The narration of the whole story is in a very unreliable tone — by a person who zones in and out of various moments in history and ‘present’. This off-handed story-telling gives you the option to label some of the brazenness of war as unreal even though the preface of the book says that most of the events did happen.

Writing wise, the story-telling steals the cake. I have no reservations that I would be extremely apprehensive to be a Kurt Vonnegut in person; it would take a true lunatic, throwing away of all societal norms, the cost to be truly yourself is indeed quite high and he has paid it. But at the end of it all, you have the pleasure of calling a book like that your work. *tips hat*

Please, please read this book.
