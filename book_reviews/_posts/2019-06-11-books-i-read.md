<br/>

Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain
: Superbly executed nostalgic trip of childhood for adults, a browse through a long-lost photo album. Any adult who snorts at the idea of reading such a book runs the risk of living a life too serious. Do not miss the opportunity to live through all the longings, loneliness, sense of adventure you felt as a kid.

<br/>

Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut
: Greedily read this book because I was blown away by Slaughterhouse Five. Another complicated tale telling of lives of characters smeared with politics, lust, greed, science. Remember that science is not all pious, and neither are all scientists. Freewheeling science is sure to step on foot of equality, as has been proven time and again by atomic bombs, nuclear energy.

Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut
: Please read this book. Reviewed <a href="https://shikha-aggarwal.github.io/2019-06-08-slaughterhouse-five/" class="post-read-more">here</a>.

Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams
: Was watching a video lecture by Douglas Adams, it was quite fun - so ended up ordering this book. Started reading this book with a tempered bias knowing that I have already read his most famous book. Was not necessary, this book is every bit of fun, hilarious, smart. Adams was an extremely intelligent, loving guy.

<br/>

Train to Pakistan by Khushwant Singh
: Closer to home, a story that tells of how well-meaning people, people who knew right from wrong - got embroiled in the devastating religious war of 1947. A story that must have repeated itself over and over in the villages all over in North India, uprooting them like a tornado - a man-made one.

<br/>

The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry
: Even though this book is highly popular, it was a bit too much of an emotional indulgence for me.

<br/>

The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh
: Strange book. Intriguing in the beginning, wanders in between, never comes around. Had to finish it to for the suspense. Weird sci-fi in Indian setting.

<br/>

The Chronicles of Clovis by Saki 
: *Super short stories that hit you in the face in the very end. Exquisite character development in a very short time and great delivery. Very precise use of words.*

<br/>

An Ideal Husband by Oscar Wilde
: Each dialogue of the play seems to be a quote in itself. Wilde is extremely funny, and captures the late 1800s society in his commentary on marriages in society's view against personal beliefs. Seems like a lot of authors from that era wrote on this topic (Jane Austen, Colette, Virginia Woolf).
