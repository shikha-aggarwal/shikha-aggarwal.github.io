Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut
: Please read this book.

<br/>

Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut
: Please read this book.

<br/>

Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency by Douglas Adams
: Was watching a video lecture by Douglas Adams, it was quite fun - so ended up ordering this book. Started reading this book with a tempered bias knowing that I have already read his most famous book. Was not necessary, this book is every bit of fun, hilarious, smart. Adams was an extremely intelligent, loving guy.

<br/>

Train to Pakistan by Khushwant Singh
: Closer to home, a story that tells of how well-meaning people, people who knew right from wrong - got embroiled in the devastating religious war of 1947. A story that must have repeated itself over and over in the villages all over in North India, uprooting them like a tornado - a man-made one.

<br/>

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain
: Indulging whims of a school-going boy; funny, nostalgic. Rare American humor :)

<br/>

The Calcutta Chromosome by Amitav Ghosh
: Strange book. Intriguing in the beginning, wanders in between, never comes around. Had to finish it to for the suspense. Weird sci-fi in Indian setting.

<br/>

The Chronicles of Clovis by Saki 
: *Super short stories that hit you in the face in the very end. Exquisite character development in a very short time and great delivery. Very precise use of words.*
