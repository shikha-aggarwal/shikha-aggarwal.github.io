Jeena peeled her eyes away from her monitor and saw colored patches in her sight. Looking at the wall on other side moved the patches to the wall. She turned off the computer and got up; her legs wobbled. Taking a moment to stabilize herself, she then tiptoed into a stretch. It had been more than 10 hours straight sitting in that chair. No matter how preemptively she started working before deadline, to work like this before a paper deadline was almost inevitable. Was it a good submission? She pushed the thought out of her brain. Later, she told herself.

She walked out of her lab and then out of the Computer Science department. The noon sun burned in her eyes and she mitigated it by squinting and smiling. She took a long breath - Fall was almost upon them. The slight chill mingled with warm sun tingled her skin. She started walking towards Thomas Street, a boulevard lined with restaurants providing student-fare - each making food just barely edible, but economical and quick.

More decisions to be made. Which business does she dare to show confidence in today? She started walking towards Bread Company, her go-to sandwich place to have the raspberry aioli mushroom sandwich. She might treat herself with a glass of wine along with it. Mid-way though, her mind convulsed at the idea of jam-filled sweet and salty sandwich. She stopped and revaluated her choice to Mirabelle bakery. Their feta and spinach croissant invariably brought joy. She could pick a couple up and walk down the tree-lined street.

Again, the butter felt nauseating to her empty stomach and she thought probably she needed something healthy. 

Jeena: Salad?

Brain: No.

Jeena: Soup?

Brain: Eww. 

Jeena: What do you want?

Brain: \<shrug\>

Jeena: Hmmph - you are really stubborn given that you haven’t eaten in ages … most of the people would be happy to eat raw grass about now.

Brain: Well, you have raised me well I suppose.

Alright, let’s settle this. Let’s walk to a grocery store - it has so many options. Something will appeal.

<i>I feel good, I knew that I would ... so good, so good, 'cause I got you.</i>

She began her walk away from all the ready-made food street and towards the DIY food store. Her stomach growled. She realized how hungry she was and should really just eat about anything. Her head felt light. Eat now, she told herself.

She walked into the grocery store and was greeted by an old lady there, “Welcome to Meijer.” She weakly smiled back at her and rushed towards the fresh produce store, with lush yellow bananas beckoning her. Right when they were under her nose, she angled her way away. With her head spinning and weirdly tricking her away from things she normally enjoyed, a full twenty-three minutes later, she walked out of the grocery store with a bag of marshmallows, a gallon of milk, and a cabbage.

As the fresh hair hit her nostrils again, she slouched her shoulders. “What was I thinking? What do I eat out of this? Arrgh!” She decided that she was clearly not thinking straight and decided to give up on choosing a meal for now. It was clearly a baffling task that she was not capable of accomplishing at the moment. So, she fetched out her phone from her jeans back pocket and dialed up her friend Raymond. She burst out the holed up energy and frustration into it as soon as she heard the click: 

“Hello! Now that my deadline is over, do you think I should call up Rafael and see if he wants to go out with me? Dude! I haven’t eaten anything in so long … I will faint if I don’t eat right at this moment, I am so friggin’ hungry - I could eat a horse right now. I think this whole Mikesh thing is weighing on my mind and I am super distracted and not able to decide what I should eat. I am kinda nervous - what do I tell him, how do I ask him? You said you will help me after my deadline and now the time has come. That joke about the panties was hilarious though, not sure if I should tell it to him when I call though. Hello?”

“Err - em, hi, this is Rafael.”

She blanked out, probably because of hunger as well. Then she removed the phone from her ear and pressed the red phone icon. She switched her phone off and slid it back.

Ignoring all the pleas from her brain, she walked right back into the grocery store, towards the lush yellow bananas and grabbed a bunch. She checked it out and ate four bananas one after the other. Her eyes welled up; she really liked Rafael. In her four years of grad life and twenty-eight years of existence, she had looked for a guy who was more aware of what he was doing, his work, play, etc. Rafael had joined her lab 5 months ago and she had come to realize during the group weekly meetings that she never wanted to miss them anymore for there was someone who was as excited and diligent about their work as she. Also, the same one’s calf muscles protruded at the right angles.

She had just wanted to go out on a date with him and being a complete n00b in this aspect of human social life, seeked advice from Raymond, her childhood friend: it was a professional environment and she didn’t want to build a rapport of a ageing graduate student who seeks out fresh entrants. She started laughing at the stupidity of it all - why on earth was she even welling up? She hadn’t even known him! It had to be lack of sleep.

Her brain was taking command again. It didn’t want to go back to an empty place, needed someone. She walked to Neeta’s apartment four blocks away, unlocked the apartment, and walked to Neeta’s room. The bed was littered with clothes and books. She wanted to scream but realized no one would hear it and instead walked to her roommate’s room. It was tidy and she recalled that she was back in Peru for a week. She shut the door and dropped in bed.

*********

When Jeena regained consciousness, there was darkness all around. She heard distant police sirens wailing but concentrated on matters more personal - that she was famished. It must be middle of night and Neeta might not have realized that she was sleeping in her house. No goddamn place would be open at this unearthly hour to deliver any food or serve a morsel. If it was before 3 am, Insomnia Cookies might be open. But sugar? You might want to sleep instead.

She covered her mouth with pillow and bursted her frustration in its face. People, people everywhere, not one to care.

What could she possibly eat? She remembered that she had bought milk from store - did she actually bring it back? She didn’t recall carrying anything back when she walked to Neeta’s place; maybe she left it near the grocery stall where she had placed the bag after the phone call. Phone call. Not again, don’t think about it right now. Oh damn, could he have called her back? She extracted the phone out of her pocket - it was still there. How sleepy she must have been!

She switched it back on. The loading bar took its sweet time. Probably installing OS update when it got the chance to. She flinged it in bed and sat up in bed, turning on the bedside lamp. She picked up a book near it - how well did the person keep her room! Would she ever know that Jeena slept in her bed while she was away? She turned the book around, “Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency” by Douglas Adams and started reading the snippet on back of the cover. Her phone came to life. It went crazy - what was going on? Another bad software release?

Impatiently, she tapped the green phone icon. Had he called back? Nothing happened. She stabbed the green icon again. The screen came up and crashed. She picked up her phone and waited for a few seconds. Did Rafael call back?

“Hey Siri! Did Rafael call me while the phone was off?” she yelled sarcastically into the phone and immediately realized her mistake. It tried to start Siri as well and that must put pressure on already depleted computing resources. She put it aside once more and resumed reading the snippet blankly. She read without understanding it and that annoyed her even more. She couldn’t believe she had skipped both lunch and dinner when she was so hungry in noon. This was a stupid behavior and she missed her home. If she were home, her meals would have just been brought to her table or room by her mom while she worked non-stop on her deadline. Life!

Then her phone screen lit up. Something caught her attention. It couldn’t be right. She stared at the notification on the locked screen. “246 missed calls & 65 messages.”

She sat stumped in the bed and the police siren seemed to grow louder and louder until it was piercing her ears. She moved her head to look outside and three police cars pulled outside the window.
