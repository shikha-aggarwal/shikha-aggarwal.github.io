Wary that I was sitting at the corner of a triangle dominated by Xin Li’s in two parts to three - one that I had not known that I didn’t know but had posted a party parrot welcoming him back and the other - well, who was not actually Xin Li - but let us for all practical purposes call him my ‘Xin Li’ because I still don’t know his name and I have my ears all perky for any mention of his name. It is so strange that no one yells at him from a distance. I see that he smiles at his screen quite often which makes me think that either there is something going on between the two, or that he chats on the messenger quite a bit.

I sat at my desk avoiding eye contact with both corners and so, had little option but to see videos, check twitter, or work. It was 9:40 am and my manager’s train would have pulled into the station around 3 minutes ago - ergo, he would be walking into the office right about now. I did the needful.

My phone buzzed and I saw a notification that there was a message on my undergrad friends group. I exercised all my willpower to not look it up because my manager was going to be in any time now. Early morning meditation. Done.

The original Xin Li yawned. He had the reputation to afford it - may be he even scored a 4 in his last review cycle he was here. How does that feel like? To be able to assert yourself - was it more to do with letting people know that you are a 4 rather than feeling it yourself? One day, I might know. Not if I keep writing these stupid updates on Xin Li triangles - it is not even the most famous triangle that people get lost in.

A quick glance at the empty hallway told me that either my boss’s train was late, or he decided to take the next train. I stretched my arms and the cow-like placid, even-tempered chewing Xin Li looked lazily away from me trying to see what I had seen. Ha ha - got him! He went back to being fixated on his screen. It was amazing how emotions or turbulent thoughts did not affect his rate of chewing. He went on in the same rhythm. Sometimes he’d have his headphones on and shake his head along but still chew at the same speed.

The female engineer with arching back came in. Both Xin Li’s sat up in their chairs and looked up - giving the forlorn look. ‘Feminism!’ my ego yelled trying to tell me I am probably a “better” person than her. It is said no views feel real till you feel the sting. If you want to feel feminism, pick up the tabs for your colleagues and dates every time you wonder if he is going to and let that burn a moon-sized fucking hole in your damn Coach handbag. Pamper your date and order that extra appetizer that he is making his mind about and make him smile. 

Ensure that dad does not pay for your wedding because when a whole generation of men grow up knowing that they don’t have to save up for daughter’s wedding, that is when they will see daughters as not something to be “looked after,” but just another person who has to sit by themselves at corners of many bermuda triangles figuring out how to deal with tough corners.

Or at-least be a cow-fighter. The cow turned his crown towards me and expelled some extra air via his mouth. It was thoughtful of him but I really didn’t need the extra carbon dioxide. On second thoughts, I think he still hadn’t got used to how much time I could spend just sitting in my chair looking at people. Only if he knew the tirade of life lessons that went through my head.
