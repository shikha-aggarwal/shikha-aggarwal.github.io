Hi! This be Shikha. Currently, I am learning to play soccer, build iPhone apps, bought a bike that wants a ride.

### my history

I was the first child project for my parents and they learnt a lot from me. They never dropped my younger brother on his head.

I am a Punjabi. I was born to eat, immigrate, and tell stories. No high intellectual expectations. My parents thought I had gone rogue when I took up Computer Science, but then when I started working for Google and went "abroad". They were relieved and started finding me a "firang" boy. That is when I again got sidetracked and got a Masters in Mathematics to see if it lands me in the Guinness book as the first Punjabi mathematician.

But I encountered the same problem everywhere: no intellectual expectations. People expected me (being a Punjabi) to stand up and be loud and funny. I was even expected to sing Punjabi songs - please thank your God that you cannot hear me on this blog. With a voice like mine, I realized I could not be a Punjabi.

And so started the journey to introspect and that always starts with a blog.

### why I write

Being a software developer, my office hours require me to seem busy on my laptop for a majority of a day. With limited Bay Area salary, I can only spend so much time shopping online. Ergo, one fine day, I thought I should start writing something.

### what do I write? 

At work, there are people from so many countries sharing their stories over lunch. I found tales all around me waiting to be repackaged and re-told. So, I started typing so much that my manager gave me a bonus even when I failed to reach my quarterly goals. Now, I have two novels in my hands that need a publisher and two others on my laptop that just need me to go to office for a few more months.
