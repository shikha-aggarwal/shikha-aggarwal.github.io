title: Who am I?
#subtitle: Why you'd want to go on a date with me

Hi!
My parents named me Shikha, and I answer to that noise mostly. Unlike most people, I have already lived a very fulfilling life - I have taught invaluable things to people around me. My parents never dropped my younger brother on his head, my ex I hear is on his path to moksha, and Cadbury is adding more gunk to its chocolates per day to meet the demand.

I am a Punjabi. I was born to eat, immigrate, and tell stories. No high intellectual expectations.
 
I cannot sing or dance. Not cannot per se. My well-wishers have told me that I <i>should</i> not. Please thank your God that you cannot hear or tango with me on this blog. If you don't have a God, please borrow your neighbors' just for this one time.

### why I write?

Being a software developer, my office hours require me to seem busy on my laptop for a majority of a day. With limited Bay Area salary, I can only spend so much time shopping online. Ergo, one fine day, I thought I should start writing something.

### what do I write? 

Words. *chuckles* No, no, come back, please. Frankly, anything. I just know that when I type, my manager gives me a bonus even when I fail to reach my quarterly goals. So, I have two novels in my hands that need a publisher and two others on my laptop that just need me to go to office for a few more months.
