Hi!
My parents named me Shikha, and I answer to that noise mostly.

### My Journey
My parents learnt a lot from me. They never dropped my younger brother on his head.

I am a Punjabi. I was born to eat, immigrate, and tell stories. No high intellectual expectations.
 
I cannot sing or dance. Not cannot. I mean, my well-wishers have told me that I should not. Please thank your God that you cannot hear or tango with me on this blog. If you don't have a God, please borrow your neighbors' just for this one time.

### why I write?

Being a software developer, my office hours require me to seem busy on my laptop for a majority of a day. With limited Bay Area salary, I can only spend so much time shopping online. Ergo, one fine day, I thought I should start writing something.

### what do I write? 

Words. No, no, come back, please. Frankly, anything. I just know that when I type, my manager gives me a bonus even when I fail to reach my quarterly goals. So, I have two novels in my hands that need a publisher and two others on my laptop that just need me to go to office for a few more months.
